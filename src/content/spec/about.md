# 关于我 / About Me

Hello. I am Daoze Tang, an incoming Master’s student in Computer Science and Technology at <a href="https://www.cau.edu.cn/" target="_blank">China Agricultural University</a>. Currently, I am in the final stages of completing my Bachelor of Engineering in Internet of Things Engineering at <a href="https://www.hrbcu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Harbin University of Commerce</a>.

My research interests lie broadly within Computer Science, with a primary focus on Computer Vision, specifically Object Detection. I am passionate about developing efficient algorithms and exploring robust visual recognition systems.

Beyond my individual research, I am deeply committed to academic community building. I established and currently lead <a href="https://dztang.net/team">a student research group</a> dedicated to mentoring motivated peers, fostering collaborative inquiry, and organizing teams for high-level academic competitions.

Outside of the lab, I find inspiration in the arts. I am a guitarist and enjoy exploring diverse literature.

I am actively seeking opportunities for academic collaboration, Joint PhD programs, and future doctoral positions. If you are interested in my research or potential cooperation, please feel free to contact me.
